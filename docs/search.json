I’ve been trying to incorporate more R in my work over the last couple of years, but I know I have a lot to learn and I’m hoping to improve my skills in this class. I’m looking forward to getting some experience with GitHub, RShiny, etc. - these are all pretty new to me but I’d love to make these tools part of my routine!"
