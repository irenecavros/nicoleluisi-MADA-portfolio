**Background**
---------
Hello! I am a 1st year PhD student in Epidemiology, Data Analysis & Modeling track. I work at Emory University as a Director of Data Analytics and Informatics Projects for a research group in the Department of Epidemiology where I provide data systems and analytic support for several HIV, COVID-19, and PWID projects. I am also an instructor at Emory, I teach mostly graduate level intro courses in SAS and R programming and survey methods. 

**Research Interests**
---------
My research interests include epidemiologic research methods, web-based survey methods, innovative data technologies for eHealth and mHealth, and data analysis and visualization.

**Course Goals**
---------
I have been using SAS for 10+ years so I will defend it to the death, but even I have to admit that R is very cool. I've been trying to incorporate more R in my work over the last couple of years, but I know I have a lot to learn and I'm hoping to improve my skills in this class. I'm looking forward to getting some experience with GitHub, RShiny, etc. - these are all pretty new to me but I'd love to make these tools part of my routine!

**Fun Fact**
---------
I was once interviewed for a job by a horse named Linus. He ate grass and threw up on me during the meeting, very unprofessional, 0/10, do not recommend.
